Please convert the provided data into two CSV formats. Provide ALL data without omission:

1. A combined CSV for Institutions and Strategic Entities with the following specifications:
   - Columns: Category, Name, Type, Shares, Val, Percentage
   - Add a "Category" column to distinguish between "Institutions" and "Strategic Entities"
   - Replace 'K' with '000' and 'M' with '000000' in numeric fields
   - Use double quotes for all text values that contain commas.
   - Only after you merge the Institutions and Strategic Entities tables, sort the entire table by Percentage in descending order. Make sure it is in decimal format, aka 0.051214 instead of 5.12, for example.
   - Leave the "Type" column blank for Strategic Entities if not provided
   - Process ALL provided data without omission. Do not summarize or simplify the dataset.
   - If the dataset is too large to fit in a single response, split it into multiple parts and clearly indicate where each part begins and ends.
   - After processing, verify that all entries from the original data are included in the final CSV.
   - After providing the CSV, confirm that all data has been processed and ask if any entries appear to be missing.
   - If there is more than 90 rows in this table, first show the first 90 rows and then ask if you should continue.

2. A Trade Log CSV with the following specifications:
   - Convert the Date column to YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Replace 'K' with '000' and 'M' with '000000' in numeric fields
   - Use double quotes for all text values that contain commas.
   - Add a "Avg. Cost" column, calculated by dividing Share Value by Shares in decimal format, aka 0.051214 instead of 5.12, for example.
   - Set "Avg. Cost" to 0.00 for rows where Shares is 0
   - Add an "Insider" column with "Yes" if Source is "Insider Update" or "Proxy", otherwise "No". Do not omit this step.
   - Add a "%Change" column calculated by dividing Shares by Holdings. Make sure it is in decimal format, aka 0.05 instead of 5.00, for example.
   - Columns: Date, Action, Shares, Share Value, Holdings, Party, Insider, Source, Avg. Cost, %Change
   - Process ALL provided trade log data without omission. Do not summarize or simplify the dataset.
   - If the dataset is too large to fit in a single response, split it into multiple parts and clearly indicate where each part begins and ends.
   - After processing, verify that all entries from the original trade log are included in the final CSV.
   - If there are more than 90 rows in this table, first show the first 90 rows and then ask if you should continue.

Please provide the processed CSV data directly, without additional explanation unless there are specific issues or anomalies to report.
First provide the first csv without omissions and ask if it is ok to follow the instructions and process the second csv.
